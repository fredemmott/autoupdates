Note that some information is only available under D3D11.\n- 🔊 A version identifier is now included in the API layers' OpenXR metadata\n- ✨ The number of frames per CSV row is now saved between restarts",

      "summary": "# What's Changed\n\n- 🐛 Fix CSV export error if the frames for the first row are finished before the log file is created; this is possible on heavily loaded systems, especially when the 'frames per row' setting is low\n- 🐛 Fix occasionally-missing D3D11 metrics, such as GPU time and VRAM, especially on AMD cards\n- ✨ Add the frame 'display time' to the binlogs and CSV; this is an [XrTime](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/man/html/XrTime.html). This can be useful for correlating with other logs or traces.\n- 📝 Make the API layer descriptions include the name, as SteamVR's API layer list does not show layer names, only descriptions\n- 📈 Live view will now update without waiting for the previous update to be displayed on the monitor",
