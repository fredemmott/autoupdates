To decrease *'Submit CPU*', you generally need to lower your graphics settings in the game.\n- 📈 Frame timings are now constrained to fit within the frame interval\n  - in games with a single-threaded render/frame loop, this does not do a difference\n  - in multi-threaded games, it is possible for each frame to take longer than one frame interval to generate\n    - the data shown in previous versions was technically correct, but confusing and misleading\n    - the data shown now is more directly usable\n\nSee [the README](https://github.com/fredemmott/XRFrameTools/blob/main/README.md#what-do-the-numbers-mean) for more details on the meaning of the measurements.\n\n## Usability\n\n- 💄 Replaced the 'live updates' checkbox with separate start-and-stop buttons for improved clarity\n- 📈 Core: copied *Frame Interval* to the timings chart, to make it easier to correlate overall framerate changes with more detailed measurements\n- 📈 D3D11: the VRAM axis limit is now rounded up to the next 5GB\n- 📈 D3D11: the VRAM axis is now labelled in multiples of 1GB\n- 📈 NVAPI:  the P-state axis is now auto-scaled\n- 📈 NVAPI: throttle reason indicators are now doubled in vertical size for improved readability",
